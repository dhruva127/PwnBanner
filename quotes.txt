My mind is loud, even when my mouth isn’t.

If you really listen, the world whispers all its secrets.
My biggest enemy has always been the part of me that still cares.
The strongest connections happen in silence.
The world is a giant loop, repeating the same mistakes until someone breaks it.

If money is the god they worship, then data is the altar we burn.
We’re not criminals. We’re the antivirus.

We don’t seek chaos. We seek correction.

Heroes ask for applause. We ask for accountability.
Corruption grows in silence. So we scream in code.
You can’t enslave a mind that refuses to run your script.
If they won’t share power, we’ll redistribute it.
